/// - Trust-based access control using trust distances
/// - Explicit permission grants through public keys
///
/// This dual approach provides flexibility in access control:
/// - Trust distances enable relationship-based access control
/// - Explicit permissions allow fine-grained access management
/// - Both mechanisms can work independently or in combination
