//! # Ingestion Module
//!
//! The ingestion module provides automated data ingestion capabilities for the DataFold system.
//! It takes JSON data, analyzes it against existing schemas using AI, and either maps it to
//! existing schemas or creates new ones as needed.
//!
//! ## Components
//!
//! * `core` - Main ingestion orchestrator
//! * `openrouter_service` - OpenRouter API integration for AI-powered schema analysis
//! * `schema_stripper` - Removes payment and permission data from schemas for AI analysis
//! * `mutation_generator` - Creates mutations from AI responses and JSON data
//! * `error` - Custom error types for ingestion operations
//! * `config` - Configuration structures for ingestion settings
//! * `routes` - HTTP route handlers for ingestion API endpoints
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! The ingestion process follows these steps:
//! 1. Accept JSON input data
//! 2. Retrieve and strip available schemas (remove payment/permissions)
//! 3. Send data and schemas to OpenRouter AI for analysis
//! 4. Process AI response to determine schema usage or creation
//! 5. Create new schema if needed and set to approved
//! 6. Generate mutations to store the JSON data
//! 7. Execute mutations to persist the data
