title: Integrating Datafold with a Vector Database
subtitle: Semantic Augmentation via Embeddings
----------------------------------------------

## Overview

This document outlines how to integrate a vector database into the architecture of **Datafold**, a schema-based, append-only, transform-driven data system. The integration enhances semantic intelligence for schema discovery, transform inference, and peer routing.

The system assumes Datafold manages immutable schema definitions and WASM-based transforms, and a sidecar vector DB handles semantic search.

---

## Goals

* Enable semantic schema and transform search
* Improve reuse via similarity-based discovery
* Maintain data privacy by avoiding raw data embedding
* Support decentralized node capability matching

---

## Architecture

subgraph Core Datafold Engine
    A[Schema Registry]
    B[Field Definitions]
    C[Append-Only Data Store]
    D[WASM Transform Engine]
    E[Mutation Scheduler]
    F[Query Executor]
end

subgraph Semantic Sidecar (Vector Layer)
    G[Embedding Generator (local)]
    H[Vector Database (Qdrant/Weaviate)]
    I[Vector ↔ Metadata Mapper]
end

## Embedding Workflow

```mermaid
graph TD
A[New Field or Transform] --> B[Controlled Input: metadata only]
B --> C[Local Embedding Model (e.g., bge-base-en)]
C --> D[Vector Embedding (e.g., 768-dim)]
D --> E[Insert to Vector DB with metadata]
```

### Metadata to Embed

* Field name
* Field type
* Description (if non-sensitive)
* Transform logic (abstracted)
* Schema context (no raw values)

---

## Use Cases

### 1. Semantic Schema Matching

* Discover existing fields or transforms similar to a new one
* Avoid redundant definitions

### 2. Transform Suggestion

* When creating a new field, suggest existing transforms based on vector similarity

### 3. P2P Query Routing

* Advertise node capabilities by embedding schema structure
* Route queries to semantically appropriate peers

---

## Security Model

* All embeddings are generated **locally**
* Embeddings include **no raw field values**
* Vector DB access is gated
* Encryption at rest and namespace isolation is enforced

---

## Best Practices

* Use open models like `bge-base-en` or `e5-base`
* Normalize field/transform inputs to consistent formats
* Chunk long descriptions if needed (<512 tokens)
* Store embedding model version in metadata

---

## Future Enhancements

* Fine-tune embedding model on internal schema/transform pairs
* Add transformer-based transform synthesis engine
* Add feedback loop for upvoting transform suggestions

---

## Conclusion

This architecture gives Datafold a "semantic brain" without compromising privacy. Embeddings serve as fuzzy lookup keys for field matching, transform suggestion, and decentralized intelligence — all without leaking underlying data.

The result: a smarter, more autonomous, and more secure data system.
