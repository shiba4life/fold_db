# PBI-11: Signed Message Authentication

[View in Backlog](../backlog.md#user-content-11)

## Overview

This PBI implements comprehensive cryptographic signature verification for all DataFold network requests, ensuring that every API operation is authenticated using Ed25519 digital signatures. This creates a zero-trust authentication model where every request must prove client identity cryptographically.

## Problem Statement

Current DataFold authentication mechanisms lack comprehensive cryptographic verification for network requests. This creates security vulnerabilities:

- Unauthenticated or weakly authenticated API access
- Vulnerability to man-in-the-middle attacks
- No cryptographic proof of request origin
- Limited protection against replay attacks
- Insufficient audit trail for request authentication

## User Stories

**Primary User Story:**
As an API consumer, I want all network requests to require cryptographic signatures so that only authorized clients can access data and all operations are authenticated.

**Supporting User Stories:**
- As a security administrator, I want cryptographic proof of every request's authenticity
- As a system auditor, I want tamper-proof logs of all authenticated operations
- As a client developer, I want clear error messages when authentication fails
- As a network operator, I want protection against replay and spoofing attacks
- As a compliance officer, I want non-repudiation for all data access operations

## Technical Approach

### 1. Signature Protocol Design

#### Request Signing Format
- Implement `SignedRequest` structure with timestamp, nonce, payload, and signature
- Use Ed25519 signatures for all request authentication
- Include anti-replay protection with timestamp windows and nonce tracking
- Create deterministic message construction for signature verification

#### Signature Verification Pipeline
- Implement signature verification middleware for HTTP requests
- Add nonce cache to prevent replay attacks
- Create timestamp validation with configurable time windows
- Integrate with existing permission system for authorization

### 2. HTTP API Integration

#### Authentication Middleware
- Intercept all API requests for signature verification
- Validate signature, timestamp, and nonce before processing
- Return standardized error responses for authentication failures
- Log all authentication attempts for auditing

#### Enhanced Endpoints
- Modify existing endpoints to require signed requests
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition period
- Add signature validation to all CRUD operations
- Implement graceful degradation for unsupported operations

### 3. Client Library Integration

#### Automatic Request Signing
- Integrate signature generation into client libraries
- Automatic timestamp and nonce generation
- Transparent request signing for API calls
- Error handling and retry logic for signature failures

#### Performance Optimization
- Signature verification caching where appropriate
- Async signature operations to prevent blocking
- Connection pooling for authenticated sessions
- Batched operations with shared signatures

### 4. Security Features

#### Anti-Replay Protection
- Configurable timestamp window (default 5 minutes)
- Nonce cache with automatic cleanup
- Request deduplication based on signature
- Protection against time synchronization attacks

#### Audit and Logging
- Comprehensive logging of all authentication events
- Signature verification success/failure tracking
- Request origin and identity logging
- Security event alerting for suspicious patterns

## UX/UI Considerations

### Error Handling
- Clear, actionable error messages for signature failures
- Guidance for resolving authentication issues
- Debugging information for developers
- Rate limiting for failed authentication attempts

### Performance Impact
- Minimal latency increase for signature verification
- Client-side signature caching where appropriate
- Async operations to prevent UI blocking
- Performance monitoring and optimization

### Developer Experience
- Transparent authentication for client library users
- Clear documentation for signature requirements
- Testing tools for authentication workflows
- Example code for common authentication patterns

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: 
  - PBI-10 (Client-Side Key Management) - Required for client signatures
  - Existing HTTP API infrastructure
  - Permission system for authorization integration
- **External**: 
  - `ed25519-dalek` crate for signature verification
  - HTTP middleware framework for request interception
  - Time synchronization for timestamp validation
- **Infrastructure**: Logging and monitoring systems for audit trails

## Open Questions

1. **Transition Strategy**: How should we migrate existing clients to signed authentication?
2. **Emergency Access**: Should there be emergency override mechanisms for signature verification?
3. **Performance Scaling**: How should signature verification scale with high request volumes?
4. **Clock Synchronization**: How should time synchronization issues be handled across distributed systems?
5. **Signature Caching**: When is it safe to cache signature verification results?
