# PBI-17: Security Architecture Event Bus Implementation

## Overview

This PBI implements Phase 3 of the security architecture simplification plan, creating a centralized event bus architecture for verification monitoring. Currently, DataFold has distributed monitoring approaches across platforms with no unified correlation capabilities. This event bus will provide real-time security event correlation, centralized monitoring, and pluggable architecture for custom alerting and response systems.

## Problem Statement

The DataFold codebase has fragmented monitoring and alerting:
- **Platform Isolation**: Each platform (Rust CLI, JS SDK, Python SDK) has separate monitoring approaches
- **No Event Correlation**: Security events cannot be correlated across platforms in real-time
- **Limited Observability**: Debugging security issues requires checking multiple separate log sources
- **Inflexible Alerting**: Adding new monitoring or alerting requires code changes in multiple places
- **Poor Incident Response**: No centralized view of security events across the system

This fragmentation leads to:
- Delayed security incident detection and response
- Difficulty troubleshooting cross-platform security issues
- Manual correlation of security events across components
- Inconsistent monitoring capabilities between platforms
- Complex integration with external security tools

## User Stories

**Primary User Story**: As a security operations team member, I want centralized event bus architecture for verification monitoring so that I can correlate security events across platforms and respond to threats faster.

**Supporting User Stories**:
- As a security analyst, I want real-time security event correlation so I can detect attack patterns across platforms
- As a DevOps engineer, I want pluggable event handlers so I can integrate with our existing monitoring infrastructure
- As a developer, I want centralized verification events so I can debug authentication issues more efficiently
- As a compliance officer, I want unified audit trails so I can generate comprehensive security reports

## Technical Approach

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Core Event Bus Architecture**
   - Rust-based event bus in [`src/events/verification_bus.rs`](../../../src/events/verification_bus.rs)
   - Async event processing with configurable buffer sizes
   - Cross-platform event serialization and transport

2. **Platform Integration**
   ```rust
   // Phase 1: Add event bus alongside existing monitoring
   let event_bus = VerificationEventBus::new(1000);
   event_bus.register_handler(Box::new(AuditLogger::new("audit.log")?));
   
   // Phase 2: Migrate existing monitoring to use events
   // Phase 3: Remove old monitoring code
   ```

3. **Event Handlers and Plugins**
   - Pluggable event handler architecture
   - Built-in handlers: audit logging, metrics collection, alerting
   - Custom handler interface for integration with external systems

### Event Types
- **Authentication Events**: Login attempts, key validation, signature verification
- **Authorization Events**: Permission checks, access denials, policy violations
- **Configuration Events**: Policy updates, configuration changes, environment switches
- **Performance Events**: Verification timing, throughput metrics, error rates
- **Security Events**: Attack detection, anomaly alerts, compliance violations

### Cross-Platform Libraries
- [`js-sdk/src/events/verification-events.ts`](../../../js-sdk/src/events/verification-events.ts)
- [`python-sdk/src/datafold_sdk/events/verification_events.py`](../../../python-sdk/src/datafold_sdk/events/verification_events.py)
- Event serialization and transport protocols

### Technical Benefits
- **Unified Monitoring**: Single system for all verification events
- **Real-time Correlation**: Cross-platform trace correlation
- **Pluggable Architecture**: Easy to add new monitoring/alerting
- **Better Debugging**: Centralized event stream
- **Scalable Performance**: Async event processing with buffering

## UX/UI Considerations

This change primarily affects security operations and monitoring workflows:

- **Event Dashboard**: Real-time security event visualization (future enhancement)
- **Alert Configuration**: Simple configuration for custom alerting rules
- **Event Filtering**: Ability to filter and search security events
- **Integration APIs**: Clean APIs for connecting external monitoring tools
- **Performance Impact**: Minimal latency impact on verification operations
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues functioning if event bus is unavailable

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Core verification event bus implemented in Rust with async processing
- [ ] Event bus integrated with existing verification flows
- [ ] JavaScript SDK event publishing to centralized bus
- [ ] Python SDK event publishing to centralized bus
- [ ] Cross-platform event correlation and trace ID support
- [ ] Pluggable event handler architecture implemented
- [ ] Built-in audit logging event handler
- [ ] Built-in metrics collection event handler
- [ ] Built-in security alerting event handler
- [ ] Event serialization and transport protocols defined
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show <5% latency impact on verification
- [ ] Graceful degradation when event bus is unavailable
- [ ] Integration tests for cross-platform event correlation
- [ ] Documentation for event types and handler development
- [ ] Migration guide from existing monitoring approaches

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: 
  - PBI-15 (Policy Consolidation) - event bus will use unified policies for event classification
  - PBI-16 (Configuration Unification) - event bus configuration will use unified config system
- **Concurrent**: Builds on infrastructure from previous PBIs
- **External Dependencies**: May require evaluation of event streaming libraries (Redis Streams, Apache Kafka, etc.)

## Open Questions

1. **Event Storage**: Should events be stored persistently, and if so, for how long?
2. **Event Transport**: Should we use an external message broker (Redis, Kafka) or build custom transport?
3. **Event Schema**: Should events use a fixed schema or support flexible/extensible event structures?
4. **Performance vs. Reliability**: What's the acceptable trade-off between event delivery guarantees and performance?
5. **Event Retention**: What are the retention requirements for security events for compliance purposes?
6. **Cross-Network Events**: How should events be correlated across different DataFold network deployments?
