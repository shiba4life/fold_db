## Migration Path Documentation

### From JavaScript SDK Legacy Format
```javascript
// Legacy format detection
if (backup.type === 'datafold-key-backup') {
  // Migrate from PBKDF2 → Argon2id
  // Migrate from AES-GCM → XChaCha20-Poly1305
  // Preserve key material with re-encryption
}
```

### From Python SDK Legacy Format
```python
# Legacy format detection
if 'algorithm' in backup and backup['algorithm'] == 'Ed25519':
  # Migrate from Scrypt/PBKDF2 → Argon2id
  # Migrate from ChaCha20-Poly1305 → XChaCha20-Poly1305
  # Preserve metadata and key material
```

### Migration Warnings
- Security improvements are logged
- Parameter upgrades are documented
- Compatibility notes are provided

## Implementation Notes

### Algorithm Support
1. **Preferred Algorithms** (Maximum Security):
   - KDF: Argon2id with memory ≥ 64 MiB, iterations ≥ 3, parallelism ≥ 2
   - Encryption: XChaCha20-Poly1305 with 24-byte nonce

2. **Fallback Algorithms** (Compatibility):
   - KDF: PBKDF2 with iterations ≥ 100,000
   - Encryption: AES-GCM with 12-byte nonce

### Platform-Specific Considerations
- **JavaScript**: Requires polyfills for Argon2id and XChaCha20-Poly1305
- **Python**: Uses cryptography library with ChaCha20-Poly1305 fallback
- **Rust**: Integrates with existing Argon2 implementation

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each platform
- Integration tests for cross-platform compatibility
- Migration tests for legacy format support
- Negative tests for error conditions

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. Full XChaCha20-Poly1305 implementation across all platforms
2. Hardware security module (HSM) integration
3. Additional KDF algorithms (e.g., scrypt)
4. Backup compression and deduplication
5. Multi-signature backup schemes

### Version 2 Features
- Quantum-resistant algorithms
- Distributed backup schemes
- Automatic backup rotation
- Cloud storage integration

## Security Considerations

### Threat Mitigation
- Strong encryption with AEAD ciphers
- Secure key derivation with memory-hard functions
- Integrity verification with authentication tags
- Secure memory handling with zeroization

### Best Practices
- Regular passphrase strength validation
- Secure backup storage recommendations
- Cross-platform security testing
- Regular security audits

## Compliance and Standards

### Standards Adherence
- RFC 9106 (Argon2 specification)
- RFC 8439 (ChaCha20 and Poly1305)
- RFC 3394 (AES Key Wrap)
- NIST SP 800-132 (PBKDF2 recommendations)

### Format Specification
- JSON-based for cross-platform compatibility
- Base64 encoding for binary data
- ISO 8601 timestamps
- Semantic versioning for format evolution
