## Root Cause Analysis

### Development Process Issues

1. **API Version Mismatches**: Dependencies and testing frameworks have evolved beyond the implemented code
2. **Type System Conflicts**: Rust type system strictness exposing design inconsistencies
3. **Integration Complexity**: Multi-language integration (Rust, JavaScript, Python) creating compatibility challenges

### Technical Debt

1. **Testing Infrastructure**: Test code not kept in sync with implementation changes
2. **Build System**: Insufficient continuous integration to catch compilation issues
3. **API Design**: Server API and client SDKs not properly coordinated

---

## Recovery Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix Compilation Issues** (Critical Priority)
   ```bash
   # Fix actix-web test API usage
   cargo fix --test public_key_registration_test
   
   # Resolve MasterKeyPair field access
   cargo fix --test unified_backup_cross_platform_test
   
   # Update CLI test Command usage
   cargo fix --test cli_key_derivation_rotation_test
   ```

2. **Establish Working Build** (High Priority)
   ```bash
   # Ensure basic compilation
   cargo build
   
   # Validate core tests pass
   cargo test --lib
   ```

3. **Validate Core Functionality** (High Priority)
   - Test key generation across platforms
   - Verify backup/recovery workflows
   - Validate server registration (once tests compile)

### Medium-Term Actions

1. **End-to-End Integration Testing**
   - Create working examples demonstrating full workflows
   - Test cross-platform compatibility
   - Validate security requirements in practice

2. **Performance and Security Validation**
   - Benchmark key operations
   - Security audit of implementations
   - Load testing of server endpoints

3. **Documentation Alignment**
   - Ensure documentation matches working implementation
   - Update examples to reflect actual API usage
   - Add troubleshooting guides for common issues
