## Key Dependencies

### Critical Path
1. Research tasks (10-1-x) form the foundation for all implementation
2. SDK implementations (10-2-x, 10-3-x, 10-4-x) can proceed in parallel after research
3. Server integration (10-6-x) enables client-server communication
4. Backup/recovery (10-5-x) requires cross-platform coordination
5. Documentation (10-7-x) follows implementation completion
6. Testing (10-8-x) validates the complete system

### External Dependencies
- WebCrypto API availability in target browsers
- Python `cryptography` package compatibility
- OpenSSL availability for CLI tools
- DataFold HTTP server infrastructure
- Platform-specific secure storage APIs
