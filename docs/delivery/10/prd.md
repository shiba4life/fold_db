# PBI-10: Client-Side Key Management

[View in Backlog](../backlog.md#user-content-10)

## Overview

This PBI implements comprehensive client-side cryptographic key management, enabling clients to generate, store, and manage their own Ed25519 key pairs without relying on server-side key generation. This approach maximizes security by ensuring private keys never leave the client environment.

## Problem Statement

Current DataFold authentication relies on server-side key management or lacks proper client key lifecycle management. This creates security and trust issues:

- Clients must trust servers with sensitive key material
- No standardized client key generation process
- Limited support for different client platforms and environments
- No client libraries for secure key management
- Unclear key backup and recovery processes

## User Stories

**Primary User Story:**
As a client developer, I want to generate and manage my own Ed25519 key pairs so that I have full control over my cryptographic identity without trusting the server.

**Supporting User Stories:**
- As a web developer, I want browser-based key generation that follows security best practices
- As a mobile developer, I want native mobile app key management with secure storage
- As a system administrator, I want command-line tools for automated key generation
- As a security auditor, I want verifiable key generation processes
- As an end user, I want secure key backup and recovery mechanisms

## Technical Approach

### 1. Multi-Platform Client Libraries

#### Web/Browser Implementation
- Use WebCrypto API for Ed25519 key generation
- Implement secure key storage using IndexedDB
- Create encrypted key export for backup purposes
- Provide JavaScript SDK for web applications

#### Desktop/Mobile Applications
- Python library with cryptography package integration
- Native key generation using platform crypto APIs
- Secure key storage using OS keychain services
- Cross-platform compatibility for major operating systems

#### Command Line Tools
- OpenSSL-based key generation for maximum compatibility
- Shell scripts for automated deployment scenarios
- Secure file-based key storage with proper permissions
- Integration with existing DataFold CLI tools

### 2. Key Lifecycle Management

#### Generation Process
- Cryptographically secure random number generation
- Ed25519 key pair generation following RFC 8032
- Key validation and testing upon generation
- Secure memory handling during key operations

#### Storage and Backup
- Encrypted key export using user-provided passwords
- Multiple backup format support (PEM, JSON, binary)
- Key recovery verification processes
- Secure key deletion and zeroization

#### Registration with Server
- Public key registration API
- Digital signature verification of registration requests
- Client identity establishment and verification
- Key status tracking and management

### 3. Integration with DataFold

#### Authentication Integration
- Seamless integration with existing permission system
- Client library support for signed request generation
- Automatic signature verification on server side
- Error handling for authentication failures

#### API Client Libraries
- High-level client libraries abstracting crypto details
- Automatic request signing for authenticated operations
- Session management and key caching
- Connection pooling and retry logic
