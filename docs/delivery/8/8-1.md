# [8-1] Research and document cryptographic dependencies

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Research the cryptographic dependencies needed for PBI 8 (ed25519-dalek, argon2, and zeroize crates) and create comprehensive implementation guides. This foundational task ensures we have complete understanding of the APIs and best practices before implementation begins.

## Requirements

1. **Web Research**: Use web search to find current documentation for each cryptographic crate
2. **API Documentation**: Document key APIs, functions, and usage patterns for each crate
3. **Implementation Guides**: Create practical guides showing how to use each crate in Rust
4. **Security Best Practices**: Document security considerations and common pitfalls
5. **Version Compatibility**: Verify compatible versions and document any version constraints

## Implementation Plan

1. **Research Phase**:
   - Web search for ed25519-dalek crate documentation and examples
   - Web search for argon2 crate documentation and best practices
   - Web search for zeroize crate usage patterns and secure memory handling
   - Review latest stable versions and compatibility requirements

2. **Documentation Phase**:
   - Create `8-1-ed25519-dalek-guide.md` with API reference and examples
   - Create `8-1-argon2-guide.md` with key derivation patterns and security parameters
   - Create `8-1-zeroize-guide.md` with secure memory handling best practices
   - Include date stamps and links to original documentation

3. **Validation Phase**:
   - Review guides for completeness and accuracy
   - Ensure all examples are practical and follow current best practices
   - Verify security recommendations align with industry standards

## Test Plan

**Objective**: Verify that research documentation is comprehensive and accurate for implementation use.

**Test Scope**: Documentation completeness and accuracy validation.

**Success Criteria**:
- All three guide documents created with comprehensive API coverage
- Documentation includes practical, working code examples
- Security best practices clearly documented
- Version compatibility verified and documented
- All external documentation sources properly cited with working links

## Verification

- [x] ed25519-dalek guide created with key generation and signing examples
- [x] argon2 guide created with secure key derivation parameters and usage
- [x] zeroize guide created with secure memory handling patterns  
- [x] All guides include working Rust code examples
- [x] Security considerations documented for each crate
- [x] Compatible versions identified and documented
- [x] Original documentation sources linked and verified accessible
