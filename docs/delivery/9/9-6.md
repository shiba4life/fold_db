# Task 9-6: Backward Compatibility for Existing Unencrypted Data

**Status**: Done  
**Related PBI**: [PBI 9: Encryption at Rest](./prd.md)

## Overview

This task implements comprehensive backward compatibility for existing unencrypted data in DataFold databases, ensuring seamless upgrades to encryption at rest without data loss or service interruption. The implementation provides flexible migration options based on operational requirements.

## Implementation Summary

### Enhanced Encryption Wrapper

**File**: `src/db_operations/encryption_wrapper.rs`

#### New Migration Modes
- **ReadOnlyCompatibility**: Read both encrypted and unencrypted data seamlessly, never encrypt new data
- **Gradual**: Encrypt new data while preserving existing unencrypted data
- **Full**: Convert all existing data to encrypted format

#### Migration Configuration
- Configurable batch sizes for large-scale migrations
- Integrity verification during migration processes
- Backup options before migration
- Context-specific migration targeting

#### Enhanced Error Handling
- Graceful fallback to unencrypted operations when appropriate
- Clear error messages when encryption keys are missing
- Different error handling strategies based on migration mode
- Validation of data format consistency

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Automatic Detection of Mixed Environments
```rust
pub fn get_migration_status(&self) -> Result<MigrationStatus, SchemaError>
pub fn detect_unencrypted_data(&self) -> Result<Vec<String>, SchemaError>
```
- Automatically detects existing unencrypted data
- Provides comprehensive migration status information
- Calculates encryption percentages for monitoring

#### 2. Flexible Migration Utilities
```rust
pub fn perform_batch_migration(&self, config: &MigrationConfig) -> Result<u64, SchemaError>
pub fn migrate_to_encrypted_with_validation(&self, context: &str, config: &MigrationConfig) -> Result<u64, SchemaError>
```
- Batch processing for large datasets
- Integrity verification during migration
- Context-aware encryption
- Detailed progress tracking

#### 3. Enhanced Backward Compatibility
```rust
pub fn get_encrypted_item<T: DeserializeOwned>(&self, key: &str, context: &str) -> Result<Option<T>, SchemaError>
```
- Seamless reading of both encrypted and unencrypted data
- Automatic format detection using magic bytes
- Context validation for encrypted data
- Graceful error handling based on migration mode

#### 4. Data Format Validation
```rust
pub fn validate_data_format_consistency(&self) -> Result<HashMap<String, u64>, SchemaError>
```
- Comprehensive validation of data formats
- Detection of corrupted or invalid data
- Per-context statistics and validation
- Integrity verification capabilities

### Database Initialization Enhancements

The existing database initialization system in `src/datafold_node/crypto_init.rs` has been enhanced to support backward compatibility scenarios:

- Detection of existing databases with mixed data
- Graceful handling of initialization in environments with legacy data
- Validation of crypto configuration for backward compatibility

### Configuration Support

**File**: `src/config/crypto.rs`

Enhanced the crypto configuration system to support migration modes:
- Migration mode configuration
- Backward compatibility settings
- Flexible migration parameters

## Usage Examples

### Read-Only Compatibility Mode
```rust
use datafold::db_operations::{EncryptionWrapper, MigrationMode};

// Create wrapper in read-only mode - never encrypts new data
let wrapper = EncryptionWrapper::with_migration_mode(
    db_ops, 
    &master_keypair, 
    MigrationMode::ReadOnlyCompatibility
)?;

// Seamlessly reads both encrypted and unencrypted data
let data = wrapper.get_encrypted_item("legacy_key", "atom_data")?;
```

### Gradual Migration Mode
```rust
// Enable gradual migration - encrypt new data, preserve old
let wrapper = EncryptionWrapper::with_migration_mode(
    db_ops, 
    &master_keypair, 
    MigrationMode::Gradual
)?;

// New data is encrypted, old data remains accessible
wrapper.store_encrypted_item("new_key", &data, "atom_data")?;
let legacy_data = wrapper.get_encrypted_item("legacy_key", "atom_data")?;
```

### Full Migration
```rust
// Perform full migration of all data
let config = MigrationConfig {
    mode: MigrationMode::Full,
    batch_size: 100,
    verify_integrity: true,
    backup_before_migration: false,
    target_context: "atom_data".to_string(),
};

let migrated_count = wrapper.perform_batch_migration(&config)?;
println!("Migrated {} items to encrypted format", migrated_count);
```

### Migration Status Monitoring
```rust
// Get comprehensive migration status
let status = wrapper.get_migration_status()?;
println!("Encryption progress: {:.1}%", status.encryption_percentage());
println!("Mixed environment: {}", status.is_mixed_environment());
println!("Fully encrypted: {}", status.is_fully_encrypted());
```

}
```

### Migration Status Information
```rust
pub struct MigrationStatus {
    pub total_items: u64,                // Total items in database
    pub encrypted_items: u64,            // Number of encrypted items
    pub unencrypted_items: u64,          // Number of unencrypted items
    pub migration_mode: MigrationMode,   // Current migration mode
    pub encryption_enabled: bool,        // Whether encryption is enabled
    pub last_migration_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>>, // Last migration timestamp
}
```

## Error Handling Enhancements

### Context-Aware Error Messages
- Clear indication of encryption vs. unencrypted data issues
- Context mismatch error reporting

- Gradual migration mode provides detailed error context
- Full migration mode ensures data integrity

### Validation and Recovery

- Efficient database iteration for large datasets

### Memory Management
- Streaming processing for large migration operations
- Minimal memory footprint during batch operations
- Proper cleanup and resource management

### Database Operations

- Context validation for encrypted data access

### Encryption Context Isolation
- Strict context validation prevents cross-context data access
- Separate encryption keys per context
- Validation of encryption format consistency

### Error Information Leakage
