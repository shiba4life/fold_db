        data_size: Option<usize>,
        encryption_context: Option<String>,
        underlying_cause: Option<String>,
    },
    // ... other variants
}

// Rich error context
pub struct ErrorContext {
    pub error_id: Uuid,
    pub timestamp: SystemTime,
    pub component: String,
    pub operation: String,
    pub metadata: HashMap<String, String>,
