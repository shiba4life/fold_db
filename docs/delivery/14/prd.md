# PBI-14: Key Lifecycle Management

[View in Backlog](../backlog.md#user-content-14)

## Overview

This PBI implements comprehensive key lifecycle management for DataFold, providing monitoring, auditing, and administrative capabilities for all cryptographic operations in the system. This creates a complete governance framework for key management across the distributed network.

## Problem Statement

While previous PBIs establish cryptographic capabilities, there lacks comprehensive oversight and management of key operations:

- No centralized monitoring of key lifecycle events
- Limited audit trails for compliance and security analysis
- No automated key health monitoring and alerting
- Insufficient tools for emergency key management
- Missing analytics for key usage patterns and security metrics

## User Stories

**Primary User Story:**
As a security administrator, I want comprehensive key lifecycle management so that I can monitor, audit, and manage all cryptographic operations in the system.

**Supporting User Stories:**
- As a compliance officer, I want complete audit trails for all key operations
- As a security operator, I want real-time monitoring and alerting for key events
- As a system administrator, I want emergency key management capabilities
- As a security analyst, I want key usage analytics and security metrics
- As an auditor, I want tamper-proof logs of all cryptographic operations

## Technical Approach

### 1. Key Registry and Tracking

#### Centralized Key Registry
- Comprehensive database of all active and historical keys
- Key metadata including creation, usage, and lifecycle status
- Relationship mapping between keys and data instances
- Cross-network key status synchronization

#### Key Health Monitoring
- Automated key expiration tracking and alerts
- Usage pattern analysis for anomaly detection
- Key strength and algorithm compliance checking
- Network propagation status for key changes

### 2. Audit and Compliance Framework

#### Comprehensive Audit Logging
- Tamper-proof logging of all key lifecycle events
- Cryptographic signatures on audit log entries
- Immutable audit trail with chain-of-custody tracking
- Compliance reporting for regulatory requirements

#### Event Correlation and Analysis
- Real-time correlation of key events across the network
- Suspicious activity detection and alerting
- Automated compliance checking and reporting
- Security incident response integration

### 3. Administrative Tools and Interfaces

#### Key Management Dashboard
- Visual overview of key lifecycle status across the network
- Real-time monitoring of key operations and health
- Administrative tools for emergency key management
- Bulk key operations for enterprise deployments

#### Emergency Response Capabilities
- Emergency key revocation with network-wide propagation
- Incident response workflows for compromised keys
- Automated security lockdown procedures
- Recovery procedures for key management failures

### 4. Analytics and Reporting

#### Security Metrics and KPIs
- Key rotation compliance tracking
- Usage pattern analysis and trending
- Security event frequency and severity metrics
- Network-wide key health scoring

#### Compliance and Audit Reporting
- Automated generation of compliance reports
- Customizable audit trail exports
- Regulatory requirement validation
- Security posture assessment reports

## UX/UI Considerations

### Administrative Dashboard
- Intuitive visual representation of key lifecycle status
- Real-time alerts and notifications for security events
- Drill-down capabilities for detailed key analysis
- Export capabilities for external analysis tools

### Alerting and Notifications
- Configurable alerting thresholds and criteria
- Multiple notification channels (email, SMS, webhook)
- Escalation procedures for critical security events
- Integration with existing monitoring and alerting systems

### Reporting Interface
- Customizable report generation with filtering and grouping
- Scheduled report delivery for compliance requirements
- Interactive dashboards for real-time analysis
- Export formats for integration with external systems

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: 
  - All previous security PBIs (8-13) - Required for comprehensive key operations
  - Database infrastructure for audit log storage
  - Network infrastructure for cross-node communication
  - Existing monitoring and alerting systems
- **External**: 
  - Time-series database for metrics storage
  - Message queue system for event processing
  - Web framework for dashboard interface
  - Notification services for alerting
- **Infrastructure**: High-availability setup for critical monitoring functions

## Open Questions

1. **Data Retention**: What are the optimal retention periods for different types of audit data?
2. **Network Partitions**: How should key lifecycle monitoring handle network partitions and eventual consistency?
3. **External Integration**: Which external security tools and SIEM systems should be prioritized for integration?
4. **Privacy Compliance**: How should key lifecycle data be handled for privacy regulations (GDPR, etc.)?
5. **Disaster Recovery**: What are the disaster recovery requirements for key lifecycle data?
