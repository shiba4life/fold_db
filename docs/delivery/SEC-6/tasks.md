**Parent PBI**: [PBI SEC-6: Migration Plan for Existing Functionality](./prd.md)

## Task Summary

| Task ID | Name | Status | Description |
| :------ | :--------------------------------------- | :------- | :--------------------------------- |
| SEC-6-1 | [Plan and Execute Migration for Existing Functionality](./SEC-6-1.md) | Done | Plan and execute the migration of existing business logic and database access to use the new centralized security layers |

## Implementation Notes

**Completed Migration Features:**
- ✅ [`SecurityManager`](../../../src/security/utils.rs) unifies all security components into a single interface
- ✅ [`SecurityConfigBuilder`](../../../src/security/utils.rs) provides flexible configuration management
- ✅ Conditional encryption based on configuration settings
- ✅ [`SecurityMiddleware`](../../../src/security/utils.rs) provides unified request validation
- ✅ Centralized key management through `MessageVerifier`
- ✅ Abstracted encryption/decryption through `ConditionalEncryption`
- ✅ Configuration-driven security behavior (signatures can be optional)
- ✅ Clean separation between client-side (`ClientSecurity`) and server-side security utilities

**Architecture Benefits:**
- Single point of configuration for all security settings
- Consistent API across signature verification and encryption
- Easy integration for new endpoints through middleware
- Backward compatibility through optional security features
- Centralized error handling and logging
