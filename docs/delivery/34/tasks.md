## Task Details

### Task 34-1: Analyze and Document Network Layer Overlap
**Dependencies:** None  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Documented mapping of all network-related types, functions, and flows
- Complete inventory of functionality in both `src/network/` and `src/datafold_node/transport/`
- Identified duplicated logic and integration points between modules
- Performance characteristics documented for each component

**Technical Tasks:**
- Inventory all public APIs and internal types in both network modules
- Map data flows and dependencies between network and transport components
- Identify duplicated or similar networking logic
- Document performance characteristics and requirements
- Document findings in architecture wiki

**Risks & Mitigation:** 
- Missed critical integration points; mitigate with comprehensive code review and DevOps team consultation

### Task 34-2: Design Unified Network Module Architecture
**Dependencies:** Task 34-1  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Architecture diagram and design document reviewed and approved by team
- Clear module boundaries and interfaces defined for unified network layer
- Migration strategy documented with performance considerations
- DevOps team approval of network configuration changes

**Technical Tasks:**
- Draft unified module boundaries and interfaces
- Design integration between core networking and transport components
- Define migration strategy with minimal network disruption
- Plan for backward compatibility with existing network APIs
- Review design with development team and DevOps stakeholders

**Risks & Mitigation:** 
- Design may not satisfy all networking use cases; mitigate by involving DevOps and networking stakeholders

### Task 34-3: Refactor and Merge Network Core Logic
**Dependencies:** Task 34-2  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All network flows use unified codebase
- Core, config, and transport logic successfully moved to new module
- Legacy networking code removed or deprecated
- Network performance maintained or improved

**Technical Tasks:**
- Move network core, config, and transport logic into new unified module
- Update references in datafold_node to use new network module
- Remove redundant networking code
- Validate network flows with existing integration tests
- Benchmark network performance before and after consolidation

**Risks & Mitigation:** 
- Network performance regression; mitigate with comprehensive performance testing and monitoring

### Task 34-4: Integrate Node-Specific API and Routing
**Dependencies:** Task 34-3  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All API and routing features available in unified module
- Node-specific networking functionality preserved
- No loss of network functionality during migration
- Integration tests validate complete feature set

**Technical Tasks:**
- Move and adapt API endpoint code to unified network module
- Integrate routing and node-specific transport features
- Update network documentation for unified interfaces
- Validate API endpoints with comprehensive integration tests
- Test routing functionality across different network configurations

**Risks & Mitigation:** 
- API endpoint disruption during migration; mitigate with careful API preservation and phased rollout

### Task 34-5: Deprecate and Remove Legacy Network Modules
**Dependencies:** Task 34-4  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- No references to legacy network modules remain in codebase
- Build and all tests pass successfully
- Network performance validation confirms no regression
- Documentation updated to reflect unified network module

**Technical Tasks:**
- Remove old network module files
- Update all imports and references to use unified network module
- Update networking documentation and developer guides
- Validate network functionality with end-to-end tests
- Validate removal with CI/CD pipeline and network integration tests

**Risks & Mitigation:** 
- Missed references could break network functionality; mitigate with thorough code search, comprehensive testing, and network monitoring
