Task 27-1: Cross-platform Configuration Audit and Requirements Analysis
Executive Summary
This analysis examines the current configuration systems across the DataFold codebase and establishes comprehensive requirements for a unified cross-platform configuration management system. The audit reveals multiple fragmented configuration approaches that need consolidation into a coherent, platform-aware system.

Format: JSON-based
Location: config/node_config.json or $NODE_CONFIG environment variable
