# PBI-12: Key Rotation and Replacement

[View in Backlog](../backlog.md#user-content-12)

## Overview

This PBI implements secure, client-initiated key rotation and replacement mechanisms for DataFold, enabling users to update their cryptographic keys without service interruption. The system supports both scheduled rotation for security hygiene and emergency replacement for compromised keys.

## Problem Statement

Current DataFold systems lack comprehensive key lifecycle management, creating long-term security risks:

- No mechanism for regular key rotation as security best practice
- Inability to quickly replace compromised keys
- Risk of permanent data access loss if keys are lost
- No atomic key replacement process
- Lack of network-wide key status synchronization

## User Stories

**Primary User Story:**
As a client application user, I want to rotate my access keys without service interruption so that I can maintain security hygiene through regular key updates.

**Supporting User Stories:**
- As a security administrator, I want to enforce regular key rotation policies
- As a system operator, I want immediate key replacement for security incidents
- As a client developer, I want automated key rotation capabilities
- As a network node, I want consistent key status across the distributed system
- As a compliance officer, I want audit trails for all key lifecycle events

## Technical Approach

### 1. Atomic Key Replacement Protocol

#### Single-Step Replacement Process
- Client generates new key pair locally (old private key signs replacement request)
- Server atomically replaces old key with new key in single database transaction
- Old key immediately invalidated across entire network
- New key becomes active instantly for all future operations

#### Replacement Request Format
- Signed request proving ownership of old key
- New public key for activation
- Reason for replacement (rotation, compromise, etc.)
- Timestamp and nonce for replay protection

### 2. Client-Side Key Management

#### Automated Rotation
- Configurable rotation schedules (e.g., every 30/90 days)
- Background key generation and replacement
- Seamless user experience during rotation
- Automatic retry logic for failed rotations

#### Manual Replacement
- User-initiated key replacement for security incidents
- Emergency replacement workflows
- Key backup verification before replacement
- Clear confirmation and audit trails

### 3. Server-Side Processing

#### Database Operations
- Atomic transaction for key replacement
- Find all data instances associated with old key
- Create new instances with identical data but new key
- Delete old instances and key registrations
- Maintain data version history and audit logs

#### Network Propagation
- Immediate broadcast of key changes to all network peers
- Consistent key status across distributed nodes
- Conflict resolution for concurrent key operations
- Network-wide key cache invalidation

### 4. Security and Audit

#### Authentication and Authorization
- Cryptographic proof of old key ownership for replacement
- Protection against unauthorized key changes
- Emergency override procedures with enhanced logging

#### Audit and Compliance
- Complete audit trail for all key lifecycle events
- Tamper-proof logging of key operations
- Compliance reporting for key rotation policies
- Security metrics and monitoring

#### Security Model
- **Client-side key generation**: New keys are generated on the client side for maximum security
- **Server-side coordination**: Server coordinates atomic key replacement across the system
- **Signature-based authentication**: All key rotation requests must be signed with the old private key
- **Rate limiting**: Configurable rate limits prevent abuse
- **Risk assessment**: Behavioral analysis to detect unusual rotation patterns

## UX/UI Considerations

### Client Applications
- Progress indicators for key replacement operations
- Clear success/failure notifications
- Backup reminders before key replacement
- Recovery instructions for failed operations

### Administrative Interface
- Key rotation policy configuration
- Emergency key replacement tools
- Key lifecycle monitoring and alerts
- Bulk key management for enterprise deployments

### Error Handling
- Clear error messages for replacement failures
- Recovery procedures for partial replacements
- Rollback mechanisms where appropriate
- Support contact information for critical issues

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Atomic Key Replacement**
   - ✅ Single atomic operation replaces old key with new key
   - ✅ All data instances updated with new key in single transaction
   - ✅ Old key immediately invalidated across entire network
   - ✅ No service interruption during key replacement process

2. **Client-Side Operations**
   - ✅ Client generates new key pair locally
   - ✅ Signed replacement request proves old key ownership
   - ✅ Automatic retry logic for failed replacement attempts
   - ✅ Secure cleanup of old key material after successful replacement

3. **Network Synchronization**
   - ✅ Immediate propagation of key changes to all network peers
   - ✅ Consistent key status across distributed system
   - ✅ Conflict resolution for concurrent key operations
   - ✅ Network partition tolerance for key updates

4. **Security Requirements**
   - ✅ Cryptographic proof required for all key replacements
   - ✅ Protection against unauthorized key changes
   - ✅ Audit logging for all key lifecycle events
   - ✅ Secure handling of key material during transitions
   - ✅ Rate limiting and risk assessment to prevent abuse

5. **Performance Requirements**
   - ✅ Key replacement completes within 30 seconds under normal conditions
   - ✅ Network propagation reaches 95% of nodes within 5 minutes
   - ✅ Database operations scale linearly with data volume
   - ✅ Minimal impact on concurrent system operations

6. **Error Handling and Recovery**
   - ✅ Clear error messages for all failure scenarios
   - ✅ Recovery procedures for interrupted operations
   - ✅ Data consistency guarantees during failures
   - ✅ Emergency recovery procedures for critical failures

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: 
  - PBI-10 (Client-Side Key Management) - Required for client key operations
  - PBI-11 (Signed Message Authentication) - Required for replacement request validation
  - Database transaction system for atomic operations
  - P2P network infrastructure for propagation
- **External**: 
  - Distributed database with transaction support
  - Network time synchronization for operation ordering
  - Monitoring and alerting systems for key events
- **Infrastructure**: High availability database setup for critical key operations

## Current Security Features

The key rotation system provides comprehensive security through:

1. **Cryptographic Authentication**: All operations require valid Ed25519 signatures
2. **Signature-based Authorization**: Old private key must sign rotation requests
3. **Rate Limiting**: Configurable limits prevent rotation abuse
4. **Risk Assessment**: Behavioral analysis detects unusual patterns
5. **Audit Logging**: Complete trail of all security events
6. **Client-side Key Control**: Private keys never leave client environment
7. **Emergency Procedures**: Documented bypass workflows with enhanced logging

## Open Questions

1. **Grace Period**: Should there be a grace period where both old and new keys are valid?
2. **Master Key Rotation**: How should database master keys be rotated (vs client access keys)?
3. **Bulk Operations**: How should mass key rotation be handled for large deployments?
4. **Backup Integration**: How should key rotation integrate with backup and disaster recovery?
5. **Cross-Network**: How should key rotation work across federated DataFold networks?
