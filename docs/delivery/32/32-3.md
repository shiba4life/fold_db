## Requirements
- Implement the unified transform execution module based on the Task 32-2 architectural design
- Create the new unified module structure at `src/transform_execution/`
- Implement the core traits and interfaces defined in the architecture
- Build the execution engine with state management capabilities
- Implement configuration management for transform operations
- Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- Include proper documentation and code comments
- Follow the module structure specified in Task 32-2 architecture
- Implement all public APIs and interfaces as designed
- Ensure backward compatibility where possible
- Include unit tests for core functionality
- Use Rust best practices and follow existing code style
- Document all public APIs with proper rustdoc comments

## Implementation Plan
1. Update task status transitions following .cursorrules format
2. Create the core module structure at `src/transform_execution/`
3. Implement the unified transform execution architecture components:
   - Core traits and interfaces
   - Execution engine with state management
   - Configuration management
   - Error handling and logging
4. Add comprehensive unit tests
5. Update `src/lib.rs` to include the new module
6. Document all public APIs with rustdoc comments

## Files to Create/Modify
- `src/transform_execution/mod.rs` - Main module file
- `src/transform_execution/engine.rs` - Core execution engine
- `src/transform_execution/state.rs` - State management
- `src/transform_execution/config.rs` - Configuration handling
- `src/transform_execution/types.rs` - Type definitions
- `src/transform_execution/error.rs` - Error handling
- `src/lib.rs` - Update to include the new module

## Verification
- Task status transitions are correctly logged in both this file and the tasks index
- Core unified transform execution module is implemented according to Task 32-2 architecture
- All public APIs are documented with proper rustdoc comments
- Unit tests provide coverage for core functionality
- Code follows Rust best practices and existing project style
