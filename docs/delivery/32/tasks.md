## Task Details

### Task 32-1: Analyze and Document Transform Module Overlap
**Dependencies:** None  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Comprehensive mapping of all transform-related types, functions, and flows
- Documented overlap and unique features between `src/transform/` and `src/fold_db_core/transform_manager/`
- Analysis includes data flow dependencies and integration points

**Technical Tasks:**
- Inventory all public APIs and internal types in both modules
- Map data flows and dependencies between modules
- Document findings in architecture wiki
- Identify duplicated logic and integration complexity

**Risks & Mitigation:** 
- Risk of missing hidden dependencies; mitigate with comprehensive code review and stakeholder interviews

### Task 32-2: Design Unified Transform Module Architecture
**Dependencies:** Task 32-1  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Architecture diagram and design document reviewed and approved by team
- Clear module boundaries and interfaces defined
- Migration strategy documented

**Technical Tasks:**
- Draft unified module boundaries and interfaces
- Design integration between execution and management components
- Define migration strategy and timeline
- Review design with development team and stakeholders

**Risks & Mitigation:** 
- Design may not satisfy all use cases; mitigate by involving key stakeholders in review process

### Task 32-3: Refactor and Merge Transform Execution Logic
**Dependencies:** Task 32-2  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All transform execution flows use unified codebase
- AST and executor logic successfully moved to new module
- Legacy execution code removed or deprecated

**Technical Tasks:**
- Move AST and executor logic into new unified module
- Update references in fold_db_core to use new module
- Remove redundant execution code
- Validate execution flows with existing tests

**Risks & Mitigation:** 
- Regression risk during code migration; mitigate with comprehensive test coverage

### Task 32-4: Migrate Transform Management Features
**Dependencies:** Task 32-3  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All management features (orchestration, registration, persistence, metrics) available in new module
- No loss of functionality during migration
- Integration tests validate feature completeness

**Technical Tasks:**
- Move and adapt orchestration logic to unified module
- Integrate registration and persistence mechanisms
- Migrate metrics and monitoring capabilities
- Update documentation for new unified interface
- Validate with comprehensive integration tests

**Risks & Mitigation:** 
- Migration complexity may introduce bugs; mitigate with phased rollout and extensive testing

### Task 32-5: Deprecate and Remove Legacy Transform Modules
**Dependencies:** Task 32-4  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- No references to legacy transform modules remain in codebase
- Build and all tests pass successfully
- Documentation updated to reflect new module structure

**Technical Tasks:**
- Remove old transform module files
- Update all imports and references to use new unified module
- Update documentation and developer guides
- Validate removal with CI/CD pipeline

**Risks & Mitigation:** 
- Missed references could break build; mitigate with thorough code search and comprehensive CI validation
