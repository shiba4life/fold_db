# 32-4 Migrate existing transform logic to unified module

## Description
Migrate existing transform logic from the fragmented modules to use the new unified transform execution module, ensuring all functionality is preserved during the transition.

## Requirements
- Migrate existing transform logic from fragmented modules to unified module
- Update primary target: `src/fold_db_core/transform_manager/` to use unified module
- Migrate secondary targets:
  - `src/db_operations/transform_operations.rs` - migrate to unified interfaces
  - `src/fold_db_core/orchestration/transform_orchestrator.rs` - integrate with new orchestrator
  - `src/schema/transforms.rs` - update to use unified types
- Maintain existing public APIs during migration
- Create adapter layers where necessary for seamless transition
- Ensure all existing tests continue to pass
- Add migration tests to verify equivalent functionality
- Follow .cursorrules workflow for task status transitions

## Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1**: Update `src/fold_db_core/transform_manager/manager.rs` to use `UnifiedTransformManager`
2. **Phase 2**: Refactor `src/db_operations/transform_operations.rs` to use unified interfaces
3. **Phase 3**: Update orchestration components to use new `TransformOrchestrator`
4. **Phase 4**: Migrate schema transform operations to unified module
5. **Phase 5**: Update all import statements and dependencies across the codebase

## Migration Strategy
Based on Task 32-1 analysis and Task 32-2 architecture:
- Replace direct usage of fragmented transform logic with unified module calls
- Update configuration loading to use `TransformConfigLoader`
- Migrate state management to `TransformStateStore`
- Convert error handling to use `TransformErrorHandler`
- Update async execution patterns to use unified `TransformOrchestrator`

## Key Migration Points
- Replace direct usage of fragmented transform logic with unified module calls
- Update configuration loading to use `TransformConfigLoader`
- Migrate state management to `TransformStateStore`
- Convert error handling to use `TransformErrorHandler`
- Update async execution patterns to use unified `TransformOrchestrator`

## Files to Modify
- `src/fold_db_core/transform_manager/manager.rs` - refactor to use unified module
- `src/db_operations/transform_operations.rs` - migrate to unified interfaces
- `src/fold_db_core/orchestration/transform_orchestrator.rs` - integrate with new orchestrator
- `src/schema/transforms.rs` - update to use unified types
- Additional files as needed for import updates and dependency changes

## Verification
- Task status transitions are correctly logged in both this file and the tasks index
- All existing functionality is preserved during migration
- All existing tests continue to pass
- Migration tests verify equivalent functionality
- Backward compatibility is maintained
- Code follows Rust best practices and existing project style

## Migration Status

**COMPLETED PHASES:**
- ✅ **Phase 1**: Updated `src/fold_db_core/transform_manager/manager.rs` to use `UnifiedTransformManager`
  - Added unified manager integration with backward compatibility
  - Implemented delegation pattern for registration and execution methods
  - Maintained all existing public APIs

- ✅ **Phase 2**: Refactored `src/db_operations/transform_operations.rs` to use unified interfaces
  - Added unified transform support methods: `store_unified_transform`, `get_unified_transform`, `list_unified_transforms`, `delete_unified_transform`
  - Implemented legacy-to-unified conversion layers
  - Maintained full backward compatibility with existing database operations

- ✅ **Phase 3**: Updated orchestration components to use new `TransformOrchestrator`
  - Integrated `UnifiedTransformManager` support in transform orchestrator
  - Added optional unified manager field for backward compatibility
  - Maintained existing orchestration functionality

- ✅ **Phase 4**: Migrated schema transform operations to unified module
  - Updated `src/schema/transforms.rs` to support both legacy and unified systems
  - Modified `register_schema_transforms` to register with both systems
  - Added unified transform definition creation for auto-registered transforms

- ✅ **Phase 5**: Updated import statements and dependencies across the codebase
  - Added necessary imports for unified transform types
  - Ensured all modules can access unified transform functionality
  - Maintained clean separation between legacy and unified APIs

## Migration Results

**Backward Compatibility**: ✅ Fully maintained
- All existing APIs continue to work
- Legacy systems operate alongside unified systems
- No breaking changes introduced

**Integration Points**: ✅ Successfully migrated
- Transform Manager now delegates to UnifiedTransformManager
- Database operations support both legacy and unified transform formats
- Schema auto-registration works with both systems
- Orchestration components are prepared for unified execution

**Code Quality**: ✅ Improved
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging
- Implemented clean delegation patterns
- Maintained existing code style and conventions
- Added migration-specific documentation
