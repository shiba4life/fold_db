# PBI-21: Middleware Systems Alignment

## Overview

This PBI aligns middleware systems across all DataFold platforms (Rust CLI, JavaScript SDK, Python SDK) to provide consistent request processing, logging, monitoring, and error handling. Currently, each platform has its own middleware patterns and implementations, leading to inconsistent behavior and complex deployment configurations. This alignment will standardize middleware architecture and enable consistent service behavior across all platforms.

## Problem Statement

The DataFold codebase has fragmented middleware implementations:
- **Rust CLI**: Custom middleware patterns in various route handlers without standardization
- **JavaScript SDK**: Platform-specific middleware implementations without shared patterns
- **Python SDK**: Separate middleware approaches that don't align with other platforms

This fragmentation leads to:
- Inconsistent request processing and response handling across platforms
- Different logging and monitoring patterns making debugging difficult
- Varying error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Complex deployment configurations requiring platform-specific middleware setup
- Difficulty correlating events and debugging across multiple platforms

## User Stories

**Primary User Story**: As a DevOps engineer, I want aligned middleware systems across all platforms so that I can deploy and monitor services consistently without platform-specific configurations.

**Supporting User Stories**:
- As a developer, I want consistent middleware patterns so I can implement request processing uniformly
- As a system administrator, I want standardized logging middleware so I can monitor all platforms consistently
- As a security engineer, I want unified error handling middleware so security events are handled consistently

## Technical Approach

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Create Unified Middleware Framework**
   - Shared middleware patterns and interfaces
   - Common logging, monitoring, and error handling middleware
   - Standardized middleware configuration and deployment

2. **Platform Integration (Consistent Patterns)**
   ```rust
   // Rust: Unified middleware adapter
   impl UnifiedMiddleware {
       pub fn process_request(&self, req: Request) -> Result<Request, MiddlewareError> {
           self.core_processor.handle(req)
       }
   }
   ```

   ```typescript
   // JavaScript: Unified middleware utilities
   export class UnifiedMiddleware {
       processRequest(req: Request): Result<Request, MiddlewareError> {
           return this.coreProcessor.handle(req);
       }
   }
   ```

   ```python
   # Python: Unified middleware implementation
   class UnifiedMiddleware:
       def process_request(self, req: Request) -> Result[Request, MiddlewareError]:
           return self.core_processor.handle(req)
   ```

3. **Middleware Pattern Standardization**
   - Common request/response lifecycle management
   - Unified logging and monitoring middleware components
   - Consistent error handling and recovery patterns

### Files to be Modified
- [`src/datafold_node/`](../../../src/datafold_node/) - Rust middleware integration (various route files)
- [`js-sdk/src/middleware/`](../../../js-sdk/src/middleware/) - JavaScript middleware utilities (new)
- [`python-sdk/src/datafold_sdk/middleware/`](../../../python-sdk/src/datafold_sdk/middleware/) - Python middleware utilities (new)

### Technical Benefits
- **Consistent Service Behavior**: Same middleware patterns across all platforms
- **Simplified Deployment**: Unified middleware configuration for all components
- **Better Monitoring**: Standardized logging and metrics collection middleware
- **Improved Debugging**: Consistent middleware behavior makes troubleshooting easier

## UX/UI Considerations

This change primarily affects operational and development experiences:

- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing middleware configurations continue to work through adapters
- **Operational Consistency**: Standardized middleware behavior for predictable service operation
- **Developer Experience**: Consistent middleware patterns for easier feature development
- **Migration Path**: Clear migration guides for moving to unified middleware systems
- **Monitoring**: Unified middleware metrics and logging for better observability

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Unified middleware framework designed and implemented
- [ ] Rust CLI/Node integrated with unified middleware with backward compatibility
- [ ] JavaScript SDK middleware utilities implemented using unified framework
- [ ] Python SDK middleware utilities implemented using unified framework
- [ ] Cross-platform middleware behavior consistency verified
- [ ] Unified logging middleware implemented across all platforms
- [ ] Consistent error handling middleware across all platforms
- [ ] Middleware configuration standardized across platforms
- [ ] All existing middleware-related tests pass with new unified system
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show no regression in middleware processing
- [ ] Middleware interoperability verified across platforms

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: PBI-20 (HTTP Client Simplification) - unified HTTP clients will work with middleware
- **Concurrent**: Can leverage unified HTTP client and configuration infrastructure
- **Dependent PBIs**: PBI-22 (Crypto Module Simplification) will benefit from unified middleware patterns

## Open Questions

1. **Middleware Order**: How should middleware execution order be standardized across platforms?
2. **Platform-Specific Middleware**: How should platform-specific middleware extensions be handled?
3. **Middleware Configuration**: Should middleware configuration be part of the unified configuration system?
4. **Performance Impact**: What's the acceptable performance overhead for middleware standardization?
5. **Middleware Testing**: How should middleware behavior be tested consistently across platforms?
