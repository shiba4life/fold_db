# PKM-1-1: Research client-side Ed25519 cryptography libraries

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Research and evaluate browser-compatible Ed25519 cryptography libraries for client-side key generation and signing operations. Focus on libraries that provide secure random key generation, efficient signing/verification, and TypeScript support for integration with React components.

## Requirements

1. **Library Evaluation**: Compare @noble/ed25519, TweetNaCl.js, and other Ed25519 implementations
2. **Security Assessment**: Verify cryptographically secure random number generation
3. **Performance Analysis**: Benchmark key generation and signing performance
4. **TypeScript Support**: Ensure proper type definitions available
5. **Bundle Size**: Evaluate impact on React application bundle size
6. **Browser Compatibility**: Verify support across modern browsers
7. **Documentation Quality**: Assess API documentation and usage examples

## Implementation Plan

1. **Research Phase**:
   - Review @noble/ed25519 library documentation and examples
   - Evaluate TweetNaCl.js as alternative option
   - Research WebCrypto API Ed25519 support status
   - Compare security audits and community adoption

2. **Evaluation Phase**:
   - Create test implementations with each library
   - Benchmark performance characteristics
   - Test browser compatibility
   - Evaluate TypeScript integration

3. **Documentation Phase**:
   - Create library comparison matrix
   - Document recommended choice with rationale
   - Create package guide per .cursorrules principle 9
