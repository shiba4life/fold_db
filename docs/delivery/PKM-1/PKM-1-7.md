# PKM-1-7: Add comprehensive testing

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Implement unit, integration, and E2E tests for cryptographic operations and UI workflows including private key import functionality. This task ensures comprehensive test coverage for all components of the React UI Ed25519 key management system before the final E2E CoS validation.

## Requirements

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions and API integrations
3. **Security Tests**: Validate cryptographic operations and security boundaries
4. **Performance Tests**: Ensure acceptable performance for UI operations
5. **Accessibility Tests**: Verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
6. **Cross-Browser Tests**: Validate compatibility across modern browsers

## Implementation Plan

1. **Unit Test Suite**:
   - Test cryptographic functions (key generation, import validation, signing)
   - Test React components (key generation, import, data storage)
   - Test import validation functions and format conversion utilities
   - Test utility functions and hooks
   - Mock external dependencies

2. **Integration Test Suite**:
   - Test API client integrations with backend
   - Test complete workflows (key generation → signing → storage)
   - Test complete workflows (key import → validation → signing → storage)
   - Test error handling and edge cases for both generation and import
   - Test session management integration

3. **Security Test Suite**:
   - Validate private keys never persist to storage
   - Test signature compatibility with backend verification
   - Validate import validation security (no private key exposure in errors)
   - Test import format validation edge cases and malicious inputs
   - Validate memory clearing on session end
   - Test cryptographic randomness quality

4. **Performance and Accessibility**:
   - Benchmark key generation and signing performance
   - Test UI responsiveness under load
   - Validate accessibility compliance
   - Test cross-browser compatibility

## Verification

- [ ] Unit tests achieve >95% code coverage including import functionality
- [ ] Integration tests cover all API endpoints and workflows (generation and import)
- [ ] Security tests validate all security boundaries including import validation
- [ ] Import validation tests cover all supported formats and edge cases
- [ ] Performance tests meet requirements (<2s key gen, <500ms signing, <200ms import validation)
- [ ] Accessibility tests pass WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for both generation and import UI
- [ ] Cross-browser tests pass on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- [ ] All tests integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Test documentation complete and maintainable
