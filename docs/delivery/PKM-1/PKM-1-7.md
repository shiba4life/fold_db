# PKM-1-7: Add comprehensive testing

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

This task is to implement the remaining **integration and end-to-end (E2E) tests** for the PBI's Conditions of Satisfaction.

Unit tests for the `KeyGenerationComponent` were created in task [PKM-1-2](./PKM-1-2.md) and serve as a foundation. This task will build on that by creating tests for component interactions, signing workflows, and full user journeys.

## Requirements

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions and API integrations
3. **Security Tests**: Validate cryptographic operations and security boundaries
4. **Performance Tests**: Ensure acceptable performance for UI operations
5. **Accessibility Tests**: Verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
6. **Cross-Browser Tests**: Validate compatibility across modern browsers

## Implementation Plan

**Note**: Unit tests for key generation are complete. This plan focuses on the remaining tests.

1.  **Integration Tests**:
    *   Test the interaction between the `KeyManagementTab` and the `KeyGenerationComponent`.
    *   Write tests for the client-side signing functionality (`useSigning` hook and utilities from `PKM-1-3`).
    *   Create integration tests that mock the `fetch` API to verify correct interaction with the backend signature verification endpoints.
2.  **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**:
    *   Using a testing framework like Cypress or Playwright (if available) or Vitest's browser mode.
    *   **Scenario 1: Full Key Lifecycle**:
        *   User navigates to the "Keys" tab.
        *   User clicks "Generate New Keypair".
        *   Verify keys are displayed.
        *   User clicks "Register Public Key".
        *   Verify success message appears.
        *   User clicks "Clear Keys".
        *   Verify keys are removed from the UI.
    *   **Scenario 2: Signed Action**:
        *   (Depends on `PKM-1-3` and `PKM-1-4`)
        *   User generates and registers a key.
        *   User performs an action that requires a signature.
        *   Verify the action is successful.

## Verification

- [ ] Unit tests achieve >95% code coverage including import functionality
- [ ] Integration tests cover all API endpoints and workflows (generation and import)
- [ ] Security tests validate all security boundaries including import validation
- [ ] Import validation tests cover all supported formats and edge cases
- [ ] Performance tests meet requirements (<2s key gen, <500ms signing, <200ms import validation)
- [ ] Accessibility tests pass WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for both generation and import UI
- [ ] Cross-browser tests pass on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- [ ] All tests integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Test documentation complete and maintainable
