# PKM-1-8: E2E CoS Test

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

End-to-end validation of all Conditions of Satisfaction for PBI PKM-1. This comprehensive test ensures the complete React UI for Ed25519 key management integrates properly with existing backend infrastructure and meets all security requirements.

## Requirements

### Conditions of Satisfaction Validation

1. **Client-Side Key Generation**: Ed25519 keypairs generated in browser using secure random
2. **Private Key Security**: Private keys stored only in React state, never persisted or transmitted
3. **Backend Integration**: Successfully integrates with existing security routes and signature verification
4. **UI Components**: Complete React components for key management operations
5. **Session Management**: Automatic cleanup of private keys on logout/session expiry
6. **Testing**: Unit tests for crypto operations, integration tests for API calls, E2E tests for user workflows
7. **Security Validation**: Zero server-side private key exposure verified through testing

## Implementation Plan

1. **E2E Test Suite Setup**:
   - Configure browser testing environment (Playwright/Cypress)
   - Set up test data and backend integration
   - Create test user accounts and permissions

2. **Key Management Workflow Tests**:
   - Test complete key generation workflow
   - Verify private key temporary storage behavior
   - Test session cleanup on logout/expiry

3. **Security Boundary Tests**:
   - Verify no private keys transmitted to server
   - Test browser storage inspection (ensure no persistence)
   - Validate signature verification flow

4. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test all API endpoint integrations
   - Verify compatibility with existing security infrastructure
   - Test error handling and edge cases

5. **Performance and Accessibility Tests**:
   - Validate UI responsiveness and performance
   - Test accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
   - Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Verification

### Primary CoS Validation
- [ ] **Client-Side Key Generation**: Browser generates Ed25519 keys without server involvement
- [ ] **Private Key Security**: Private keys confirmed in React state only, never persisted/transmitted
- [ ] **Backend Integration**: All existing security routes work with new UI components
- [ ] **UI Components**: All key management operations available through React interface
- [ ] **Session Management**: Private keys automatically cleared on logout/session expiry
- [ ] **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and E2E tests all passing
- [ ] **Security Validation**: Zero server-side private key exposure confirmed

### Additional Validation
- [ ] Performance meets requirements (<2s key generation, <500ms signing)
- [ ] Accessibility standards met (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Error handling covers all edge cases
- [ ] Integration with existing audit logging verified
- [ ] Documentation complete and accurate
