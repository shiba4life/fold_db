# PBI-26: Unify reporting and summary structures across security modules

[View in Backlog](../backlog.md#user-content-26)

## Overview

This PBI aims to consolidate all reporting and summary structures across security modules into a unified shared module or interface. The goal is to ensure reporting is consistent, maintainable, and free from duplication or conflicts.

## Problem Statement

Currently, reporting and summary structs are defined independently across multiple security modules, leading to:
- Duplication of similar or identical structs
- Inconsistent reporting formats and field names
- Increased maintenance burden
- Higher risk of errors and inconsistencies
- Fragmented documentation and developer experience

## User Stories

- As a security architect, I want all reporting and summary structures across security modules to be unified so that reporting is consistent and easier to maintain.
- As a developer, I want to use reporting structs from a single location so that I can easily maintain and extend reporting features.
- As a maintainer, I want to eliminate duplicate reporting structs so that updates are consistent across all modules.

## Technical Approach

1. Audit all existing reporting and summary structs across security modules.
2. Design a unified set of reporting/summary structs or interfaces.
3. Implement a shared module for these unified structures.
4. Refactor all security modules to use the shared reporting structs.
5. Update and verify all relevant tests.
6. Update technical documentation to reflect the new unified reporting structures.

## UX/UI Considerations

- No direct user-facing changes; improvements are internal for maintainability and developer experience.
- Consistent struct naming and documentation for easier onboarding and code review.

## Acceptance Criteria

- All reporting and summary structs are defined in a shared module or follow a common interface.
- All modules refactored to use unified reporting structures.
- No duplicate or conflicting reporting structs remain.
- Technical documentation updated to reflect unified reporting.

## Dependencies

- Access to all security modules and their reporting/summary structs.
- Coordination with ongoing development in security modules.

## Open Questions

1. Should the shared module be a new file or integrated into an existing core module?
2. Are there external consumers of current reporting structs that require migration support?
3. Should we standardize field naming conventions as part of this unification?

## Related Tasks

Tasks will be tracked in [tasks.md](./tasks.md) and include:
- Audit and analysis
- Design
- Implementation
- Refactoring
- Testing
- Documentation
- Final verification
