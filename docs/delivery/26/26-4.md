## Requirements

- Refactor all modules to use shared reporting structs
- Remove old/duplicate struct definitions
- Update all imports and usages

## Implementation Plan

1. Identify all modules using reporting/summary structs
2. Update imports to use shared module
3. Remove local/duplicate struct definitions
4. Update code to use unified structs
5. Ensure all modules compile and pass tests

## Verification

- All modules use shared reporting structs
- No duplicate struct definitions remain
- All code compiles and tests pass
