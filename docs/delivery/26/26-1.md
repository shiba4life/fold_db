# 26-1 Comprehensive audit of reporting and summary structs

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Identify and document all reporting and summary structs across security modules. Catalog duplicates, inconsistencies, and usage patterns. This foundational audit will inform the design and implementation of unified reporting structures.

## Requirements

- Identify all reporting and summary structs in security modules
- Document duplicates and inconsistencies
- Map usage patterns and dependencies
- Provide a comprehensive inventory for design phase

## Implementation Plan

1. Search codebase for reporting/summary struct definitions
2. Catalog all relevant structs, noting file and module
3. Document duplicates and inconsistencies
4. Map usage and dependencies for each struct
5. Produce a comprehensive inventory document

## Verification

- Inventory document lists all reporting/summary structs
- Duplicates and inconsistencies are clearly documented
- Usage patterns and dependencies are mapped
- Inventory reviewed and approved by architect

## Files Modified

- docs/delivery/26/26-1.md (this file)
- (Inventory document to be created in analysis/ or similar location)
