# Task 33-1: Detailed Cryptographic Module Analysis

## 1. Module Inventory & Relationships

**Core Types & Config:**
- [`src/security_types.rs`](../src/security_types.rs): Centralized enums for security levels, rotation status, severity, etc.
- [`src/config/crypto.rs`](../src/config/crypto.rs): Crypto config (encryption enablement, master key, derivation).
- [`src/config/key_rotation_policy.rs`](../src/config/key_rotation_policy.rs): Policy objects for key rotation, enforcement, and metadata.

**Database Operations:**
- [`src/db_operations/encrypted_backup.rs`](../src/db_operations/encrypted_backup.rs): Encrypted backup/restore (AES-256-GCM).
- [`src/db_operations/encryption_wrapper.rs`](../src/db_operations/encryption_wrapper.rs): Transparent DB encryption, migration, context management.
- [`src/db_operations/crypto_metadata.rs`](../src/db_operations/crypto_metadata.rs): Storage/retrieval of crypto metadata (public keys, algorithms).
- [`src/db_operations/key_rotation_operations.rs`](../src/db_operations/key_rotation_operations.rs): Atomic key rotation, audit, rollback.

**CLI & Key Management:**
- [`src/cli/crypto_commands.rs`](../src/cli/crypto_commands.rs): CLI command definitions for crypto ops.
- [`src/cli/command_handlers/crypto_handler.rs`](../src/cli/command_handlers/crypto_handler.rs): CLI command dispatch for crypto/key ops.
- [`src/cli/commands/crypto.rs`](../src/cli/commands/crypto.rs): Handlers for crypto init, status, validation.
- [`src/cli/commands/keys/backup.rs`](../src/cli/commands/keys/backup.rs): Key backup/restore (with optional double encryption).
- [`src/cli/commands/keys/rotation.rs`](../src/cli/commands/keys/rotation.rs): Key rotation/versioning (CLI-side).
- [`src/cli/commands/keys/storage.rs`](../src/cli/commands/keys/storage.rs): Key storage/retrieval, versioning.

**Verification:**
- [`src/cli/verification/verification_engine.rs`](../src/cli/verification/verification_engine.rs): Signature verification engine, config, error handling.

**Network:**
- [`src/network/key_propagation.rs`](../src/network/key_propagation.rs): Key rotation event propagation, conflict resolution.

## 2. Overlap & Duplication Analysis

- **Key Management:** 
  - Both DB (`encryption_wrapper`, `key_rotation_operations`) and CLI (`keys/rotation.rs`, `keys/storage.rs`) implement key rotation, storage, and backup logic, with similar but not unified error handling and metadata.
  - Multiple representations of key metadata and versioning (e.g., `KeyVersionMetadata` in CLI, `KeyRotationRecord` in DB).

- **Configuration:**
  - Crypto config (`CryptoConfig`, `MasterKeyConfig`) is used in both DB and CLI, but validation and enforcement logic is duplicated in CLI handlers and DB wrappers.
  - Key rotation policy logic is split between config and DB, with some overlap in policy enforcement and status tracking.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Redundant error types and handling patterns across modules (e.g., `KeyError`, `CryptoError`, `SchemaError`).

- **Security Levels & Status:**
  - Centralized in `security_types.rs`, but some modules (CLI, DB) still use local enums or wrappers for severity/status.

---

## 3. Architecture Review

- **Separation of Concerns:** 
  - Good separation between config, DB, CLI, and network, but boundaries are blurred by duplicated logic (e.g., key rotation, backup).
- **Dependencies:** 
  - Many modules depend on core types/config, but also reimplement similar logic (e.g., passphrase handling, key derivation).

---

## 4. Security Assessment

- **Patterns:**
  - Consistent use of strong primitives (AES-256-GCM, Argon2, Ed25519).
  - Metadata integrity via checksums (SHA-256).
  - Passphrase-based and random key support.
- **Potential Vulnerabilities:**
  - Fragmented error handling may lead to inconsistent reporting or missed edge cases.
  - Multiple places where passphrases are handledâ€”risk of inconsistent prompting or storage.
  - Policy enforcement logic is not fully unified, increasing risk of bypass.

---

## 5. Consolidation Opportunities

- **Key Management:** 
  - Unify key metadata/versioning structures and error handling.
  - Centralize key rotation logic (single source for both DB and CLI).
- **Configuration:** 
  - Single validation/enforcement layer for crypto config.
- **Error Handling:** 
  - Shared error types and reporting for all crypto modules.
- **Policy Enforcement:** 
  - Move all policy logic to a single module, referenced by both DB and CLI.

---

## 6. Migration Considerations

- **Challenges:**
  - Refactoring will require careful migration of key metadata and rotation records.
  - Need to ensure backward compatibility for existing encrypted data and backups.
  - CLI and DB must agree on new unified structures.

- **Requirements:**
  - Migration utilities for key metadata and config.
  - Comprehensive test coverage for all migration paths.

---

## 7. Primitive vs Operational Layer Mapping

- **Primitive Layer:** 
  - Crypto primitives (AES, Argon2, Ed25519) are mostly in `crypto` and used by wrappers.
- **Operational Layer:** 
  - Key management, backup, rotation, and verification are implemented in both DB and CLI, with some overlap.
