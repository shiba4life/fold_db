# 31-1 Identify and delete orphaned files

[Back to task list](../tasks.md)

## Description
Scan the entire repository to identify files that are not referenced or used anywhere in the codebase, documentation, or build/test scripts. Generate a report of candidate orphaned files, review them, and delete only those confirmed as unused. Ensure no required functionality, documentation, or tests are broken by the cleanup.

## Requirements
- Scan the entire repository for files not referenced by code, documentation, or build/test scripts.
- Generate a report of candidate orphaned files for review.
- Review the list to avoid accidental deletion of necessary files.
- Delete only files confirmed as unused.
- Ensure all tests pass after cleanup.
- Document all deletions and the review process.

## Implementation Plan
1. Define criteria for orphaned files (not referenced in code, docs, or scripts).
2. Use automated tools/scripts to scan the repository and identify candidate files.
3. Generate a report and review with the team/user.
4. Delete confirmed orphaned files.
5. Run all tests to ensure nothing is broken.
6. Document the process and results in the task file.

## Verification
- All orphaned files are identified and reviewed.
- Only files confirmed as unused are deleted.
- No required functionality, documentation, or tests are broken.
- A report of deleted files is included in the task documentation.

## Files Modified
- List of deleted files (to be filled after implementation)
