# PBI-31: Codebase Cleanup – Remove Orphaned Files

## Overview
This PBI aims to improve codebase maintainability by identifying and removing files that are not referenced or used anywhere in the project.

## Problem Statement
Over time, unused or orphaned files can accumulate in the repository, leading to confusion, increased maintenance burden, and potential errors. Regular cleanup is necessary to ensure the codebase remains healthy.

## User Stories
- As a developer, I want to ensure that all files in the repository serve a purpose and are referenced by code, documentation, or build/test scripts.
- As a maintainer, I want to reduce technical debt by removing dead code and unused assets.

## Technical Approach
- Define criteria for "orphaned" (unreferenced/unused) files.
- Use automated tools and/or scripts to scan the codebase for files not referenced by code, documentation, or build/test scripts.
- Generate a report of candidate orphaned files for review.
- Manually review the list to avoid accidental deletion of necessary files.
- Delete confirmed orphaned files.
- Ensure all tests pass after cleanup.

## UX/UI Considerations
N/A – This is a developer-facing maintenance task.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All orphaned files are identified and reviewed.
- Only files confirmed as unused are deleted.
- No required functionality, documentation, or tests are broken.
- A report of deleted files is included in the task documentation.
- The process is documented for future use.

## Dependencies
- None anticipated.

## Open Questions
- Should certain directories (e.g., `data/`, `examples/`) be excluded from cleanup?
- Are there any files that should always be preserved, even if unreferenced?
