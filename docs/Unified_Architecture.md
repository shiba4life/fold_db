# Unified Architecture Summary

## Overview

With fallback mechanisms removed, DataFold now relies solely on **DbOperations** for all database access. This document consolidates the final architecture details from previous implementation phases into one reference.

## Key Changes from Phases 2 & 3

- **SchemaCore Integration**: Schema state and persistence operations now use DbOperations. Legacy `SchemaStorage` has been removed in favor of unified access.
- **TransformManager Integration**: Transform registration and mapping persistence are routed through DbOperations. The manager exposes a single constructor requiring DbOperations.
- **FoldDB Updates**: Components receive a shared `Arc<DbOperations>` instance during initialization. There are no direct sled tree accesses.
- **Fallback Removal**: All legacy constructors and code paths that bypassed DbOperations were deleted. Every component fails fast if DbOperations is unavailable.

## Resulting Architecture

The system follows the pure unified design illustrated in [Pure_Unified_Architecture_Diagram.md](./Pure_Unified_Architecture_Diagram.md):

1. **FoldDB** creates `SchemaCore`, `TransformManager`, and `AtomManager` using the same DbOperations handle.
2. **DbOperations** is the single interface for metadata, schema, transform, orchestrator, atom, and permission operations.
3. **Sled** remains the physical storage engine accessed only through DbOperations.

## Benefits Achieved

- **Simplicity** – one constructor per component and one database access path.
- **Consistency** – uniform error handling and behavior across all operations.
- **Maintainability** – reduced code complexity and easier testing.
- **Extensibility** – clear foundation for future features like transactions and caching.

## Verification

All existing tests continue to pass after fallback removal, confirming the stability of the unified architecture.
