# Task 11-7-2: Comprehensive Replay Attack Validation Framework

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive replay attack validation framework implemented for DataFold's signature authentication system. The framework validates the effectiveness of replay attack prevention mechanisms across all security profiles and client implementations.

## Architecture

The validation framework consists of four main components:

### 1. Replay Attack Tests (`tests/security/replay_attack_tests.rs`)

Core replay attack simulation and validation functionality:

- **ReplayAttackTestRunner**: Main test runner coordinating all attack scenarios
- **AttackScenario**: Configurable attack patterns with different strategies
- **ValidationReport**: Comprehensive results with metrics and recommendations

**Key Features:**
- Immediate replay attack detection
- Delayed replay with time windows
- Timestamp manipulation attacks
- Nonce collision and prediction attempts
- High-frequency replay flooding
- Performance impact measurement

### 2. Attack Simulation Tools (`tests/security/attack_simulation_tools.rs`)

Advanced attack simulation with realistic attack patterns:

- **AttackSimulator**: Orchestrates complex multi-vector attacks
- **AttackPattern**: Defines various attack methodologies
- **PerformanceImpact**: Measures system performance under attack

**Attack Types:**
- Immediate replay attacks
- Delayed replay with time skew
- Bulk replay flooding
- Timestamp manipulation
- Nonce prediction attempts
- Multi-vector coordinated attacks

### 3. Cross-Platform Validation (`tests/security/cross_platform_validation.rs`)

Ensures consistent replay prevention across all client implementations:

- **CrossPlatformValidator**: Tests behavior consistency across platforms
- **ClientImplementation**: Supports Rust server, JavaScript SDK, Python SDK, CLI client
- **ConsistencyAnalysis**: Identifies implementation gaps and inconsistencies

**Validation Areas:**
- Replay detection consistency
- Error message standardization
- Performance characteristics
- Time synchronization handling
- Implementation gap detection

### 4. Performance Benchmarks (`tests/security/performance_benchmarks.rs`)

Comprehensive performance testing under attack conditions:

- **PerformanceBenchmarkRunner**: Measures system performance under various attack loads
- **AttackIntensity**: Configurable attack intensity levels (Low/Medium/High/Extreme)
- **ScalabilityAnalysis**: Identifies performance bottlenecks and capacity limits

**Metrics:**
- Response time degradation
- Memory usage impact
- Throughput reduction
- Scalability characteristics
- Resource utilization

### 5. Validation Runner (`tests/security/replay_attack_validation_runner.rs`)

Main orchestrator combining all validation components:

- **ComprehensiveReplayValidationRunner**: Coordinates all test suites
- **ValidationScore**: Overall security effectiveness scoring
- **ExecutiveSummary**: Stakeholder-ready assessment report

## Security Profiles Tested

The framework validates all three security profiles:

### Strict Profile
- **Time Window**: 1 minute
- **Clock Skew Tolerance**: 5 seconds
- **Features**: RFC 3339 timestamps, UUID4 nonces, aggressive rate limiting
- **Use Case**: High-security production environments

### Standard Profile (Default)
- **Time Window**: 5 minutes
- **Clock Skew Tolerance**: 30 seconds
- **Features**: Balanced security and usability
- **Use Case**: General production deployments

### Lenient Profile
- **Time Window**: 10 minutes
- **Clock Skew Tolerance**: 2 minutes
- **Features**: Relaxed validation for development
- **Use Case**: Development and testing environments

## Attack Scenarios

### 1. Immediate Replay Attacks
Tests the system's ability to detect and block immediate replay attempts:
```rust
// First request succeeds
assert!(state.check_and_store_nonce("nonce-123", timestamp).is_ok());

// Immediate replay should fail
assert!(state.check_and_store_nonce("nonce-123", timestamp).is_err());
```

### 2. Delayed Replay Attacks
Validates time window enforcement:
```rust
// Original request
state.check_and_store_nonce("nonce-456", timestamp);

// Replay after delay (within/outside window)
let result = state.check_and_store_nonce("nonce-456", timestamp + delay);
```

### 3. Timestamp Manipulation
Tests timestamp validation boundaries:
- Future timestamps beyond tolerance
- Past timestamps outside time window
- Invalid timestamp formats
- Clock synchronization scenarios

### 4. Nonce Prediction Attacks
Validates nonce randomness and format requirements:
- Sequential nonce attempts
- Predictable pattern detection
- UUID4 format validation
- Collision resistance testing

### 5. High-Frequency Flooding
Tests system resilience under attack load:
- Concurrent replay attempts
- Rate limiting effectiveness
- Memory usage under stress
- Performance degradation measurement

## Usage

### Running Complete Validation

```rust
use datafold::tests::security::*;

#[tokio::test]
async fn run_comprehensive_validation() {
    let results = run_comprehensive_replay_validation().await.unwrap();
    
    println!("Overall Score: {:.1}%", results.validation_score.overall_score);
    println!("Security Effectiveness: {:.1}%", 
             results.security_effectiveness.overall_detection_rate * 100.0);
    println!("Performance Impact: {:.1}%", 
             results.performance_impact.performance_degradation_percent);
}
```

### Quick CI/CD Validation

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn quick_validation_for_ci() {
    let results = run_quick_replay_validation().await.unwrap();
    
    // Assert minimum security requirements
    assert!(results.security_effectiveness.overall_detection_rate >= 0.95);
    assert!(results.performance_impact.performance_degradation_percent <= 25.0);
    assert!(results.validation_score.overall_score >= 80.0);
}
```

### Individual Component Testing

```rust
// Test specific attack scenarios
let mut runner = ReplayAttackTestRunner::new()?;
let results = runner.run_all_scenarios().await?;

// Run attack simulations
let config = AttackSimulationConfig::default();
let mut simulator = AttackSimulator::new(config)?;
let sim_results = simulator.run_all_simulations().await?;

// Cross-platform validation
let config = CrossPlatformConfig::default();
let mut validator = CrossPlatformValidator::new(config)?;
let cross_results = validator.run_validation().await?;

// Performance benchmarks
let config = BenchmarkConfig::default();
let mut benchmarks = PerformanceBenchmarkRunner::new(config)?;
let perf_results = benchmarks.run_benchmarks().await?;
```
