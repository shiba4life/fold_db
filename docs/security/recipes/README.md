## üõ°Ô∏è Security Principles

All recipes are built on these core security principles:

### Defense in Depth
Multiple layers of security controls working together

### Zero Trust Architecture
Never trust, always verify approach to authentication

### Principle of Least Privilege
Minimal access rights for maximum security

### Secure by Default
Security-first configuration and implementation

### Continuous Monitoring
Real-time security event detection and response

## üîß Integration Guidelines

### SDK Integration
- Leverage automatic signature injection capabilities
- Use provided security configurations
- Follow framework-specific best practices

### Custom Implementations
- Adhere to RFC 9421 standards strictly
- Implement all required security controls
- Use cryptographically secure random sources

### Legacy System Integration
- Gradual migration strategies
- Backward compatibility considerations
- Security gap analysis and mitigation

## üìä Security Metrics

Track these key security metrics:

### Authentication Metrics
- Signature verification success rate
- Authentication latency
- Failed authentication attempts
- Key rotation frequency

### Security Metrics
- Detected replay attempts
- Signature validation errors
- Security event frequency
- Incident response time

### Performance Metrics
- Signing operation latency
- Verification operation latency
- Cache hit rates
- Resource utilization

## üÜò Emergency Procedures

### Security Incident Response
1. **[Immediate Response](emergency/immediate-response.md)** - First 5 minutes
