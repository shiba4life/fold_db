# Unified Reporting Documentation Update & Creation Plan

## 1. Documentation Audit & Update Plan

### A. Update Existing Documentation
- Review and update all references to old reporting structures in:
  - `docs/` (especially compliance, performance, event correlation, and reporting docs)
  - Module-level documentation in affected source files (e.g., compliance, performance, event correlation modules)
  - Any README files referencing reporting
  - Architecture/design docs (e.g., diagrams, rationale, design decisions)
- Update API documentation for:
  - Compliance, performance, and event correlation modules to reference the new unified reporting types and interfaces
  - Any endpoints or CLI commands that now use unified reporting structures
- Update architectural diagrams to show the unified reporting flow and interfaces

### B. Create New Documentation
- **Unified Reporting Architecture Guide**
  - Overview of the unified reporting system and its rationale
  - Key design principles (consistency, extensibility, type safety, flexibility, security)
  - High-level architecture diagram (see below)
- **Comprehensive API Documentation**
  - Document all public types: `UnifiedReport`, `UnifiedReportConfig`, `UnifiedReportFormat`, `UnifiedReportMetadata`, `UnifiedSummarySection`, and all section types (e.g., `ExecutiveSummary`)
  - Document digital signature functionality and configuration options
  - Usage examples (Rust code snippets)
- **Migration Patterns**
  - Guide for migrating existing modules to the unified reporting system
  - Patterns for extending reporting with new section types
  - Best practices for section naming and data structure
- **Usage Examples & Best Practices**
  - Example: Creating a report, adding sections, configuring output formats, enabling digital signatures
  - Recommendations for structuring reports and sections

## 2. Proposed Documentation Structure

### A. `docs/reporting/unified-reporting-architecture.md` (NEW)
- Rationale for unification
- Architecture diagram (see below)
- Core components and their relationships
- Design principles and benefits

### B. `docs/reporting/api.md` (NEW or UPDATED)
- Detailed API documentation for all unified reporting types and traits
- Example usage patterns
- Digital signature support

### C. `docs/reporting/migration-guide.md` (NEW)
- Step-by-step migration instructions for modules
- Example: Refactoring a legacy report to use `UnifiedReport` and `UnifiedSummarySection`
- Common pitfalls and solutions

### D. `docs/reporting/best-practices.md` (NEW)
- Section naming conventions
- Data structure recommendations
- Security and signature best practices

### E. Update Existing Docs
- Update any references in compliance, performance, event correlation, and architecture docs to use the new unified reporting system
- Update diagrams in architecture/design docs

## 4. Key Documentation Content

- **UnifiedReport**: Main container for all reports, supports multiple formats, digital signatures, and dynamic sections.
- **UnifiedSummarySection trait**: Base trait for all report sections; modules implement this for custom sections.
- **Report Formats**: Supported formats (PDF, JSON, CSV, HTML, XML, Markdown).
- **Digital Signature**: How to enable, verify, and configure signatures for reports.
- **Migration**: How to refactor legacy reports to use the unified system.
- **Best Practices**: Naming, structuring, and extending reports.

## 5. Action Plan

1. Audit and update all existing documentation in `docs/`, module-level docs, and READMEs.
2. Create new documentation as outlined above.
3. Update or create diagrams to reflect the new architecture.
4. Ensure all API docs and usage examples are up to date and reference the unified system.
5. Document migration patterns and best practices for future extensibility.
