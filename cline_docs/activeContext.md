# Active Context

## Current Task
Implementing schema system enhancements:
- Schema transformation capabilities with field-level mapping
- Advanced schema relationship management
- Error handling improvements for schema operations
- Test coverage expansion for schema transformations
- Schema persistence and validation refinements

## Recent Changes
- Enhanced schema management system
  - Added robust schema persistence with JSON storage
  - Implemented comprehensive field mapping between schemas
  - Added schema validation and loading from disk
  - Improved error handling for schema operations
  - Added thread-safe schema operations
- Added schema transformation capabilities
  - Field-level mapping support with validation
  - Reference tracking between schemas
  - Automatic field updates during transformation
  - Schema relationship management and tracking
  - Schema persistence with version control
- Improved testing infrastructure
  - Added schema mapping integration tests
  - Enhanced unit test coverage
  - Added schema transformation test cases
  - Implemented concurrent operation tests

## Next Steps
- Further enhance schema transformation capabilities
- Implement advanced field mapping validations
- Add performance optimizations for schema operations
- Expand test coverage for edge cases
- Improve error recovery mechanisms
