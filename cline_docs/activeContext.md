# Active Context

## Current Task
Implementing a P2P layer where nodes can connect to each other and get each other's approved schema list.

## Recent Changes
1. Implemented P2P Network Layer:
   - Added libp2p dependency for P2P networking
   - Created network module with core components:
     - NetworkCore: Main component for P2P communication
     - SchemaService: Handles schema availability checking
     - Error handling and configuration

2. Implemented Schema Availability Checking:
   - Added ability to check which schemas are available on remote nodes
   - Created protocol for schema requests and responses
   - Added testing infrastructure for schema availability

3. Integrated Network Layer with DataFoldNode:
   - Added network initialization and management methods to DataFoldNode
   - Implemented schema checking functionality
   - Added proper error handling for network operations

4. Enhanced Network Configuration:
   - Added comprehensive configuration options
   - Implemented builder pattern for flexible configuration
   - Added support for mDNS discovery control

5. Added Testing Infrastructure:
   - Created unit tests for network components
   - Added integration tests for DataFoldNode with network layer
   - Implemented mock peer functionality for testing

6. Updated Documentation:
   - Created detailed network layer design documentation
   - Documented the simplified P2P approach using libp2p
   - Added information about schema exchange flow
   - Updated network layer documentation with new features

## Next Steps
1. Implement schema synchronization capabilities
2. Add Kademlia DHT for wider peer discovery
3. Implement more advanced security features
4. Add node reputation tracking
5. Create more comprehensive tests for edge cases
6. Implement custom protocol handlers for specialized operations

## Implementation Details

### Network Layer Architecture
- Uses libp2p for P2P networking capabilities
- Simplified approach focusing on schema availability checking
- Privacy-preserving design (only shares schemas when explicitly requested)
- Efficient request-response protocol
- Configurable mDNS discovery

### Schema Exchange Flow
1. Node A discovers Node B through mDNS
2. Node A sends CheckSchemas request with list of schema names
3. Node B checks which schemas from the list are available
4. Node B responds with subset of available schemas
5. Node A receives and processes the response

### Security Considerations
- Noise protocol encryption for all connections
- PeerId-based authentication
- Automatic connection management
- Node validation checks
- Error handling for security violations
- Configurable connection limits and timeouts
