# Active Context

## Current Task
Implementing a P2P layer where nodes can connect to each other and get each other's approved schema list.

## Recent Changes
1. Implemented P2P Network Layer:
   - Added libp2p dependency for P2P networking
   - Created network module with core components:
     - NetworkCore: Main component for P2P communication
     - SchemaService: Handles schema availability checking
     - Error handling and configuration

2. Implemented Schema Availability Checking:
   - Added ability to check which schemas are available on remote nodes
   - Created protocol for schema requests and responses
   - Added testing infrastructure for schema availability

3. Updated Documentation:
   - Created detailed network layer design documentation
   - Documented the simplified P2P approach using libp2p
   - Added information about schema exchange flow

## Next Steps
1. Integrate the network layer with the DataFoldNode
2. Implement the full libp2p functionality:
   - Add proper mDNS discovery
   - Implement the request-response protocol
   - Add proper error handling for network operations
3. Add configuration options for the network layer
4. Create more comprehensive tests for the network layer
5. Add schema synchronization capabilities

## Implementation Details

### Network Layer Architecture
- Uses libp2p for P2P networking capabilities
- Simplified approach focusing on schema availability checking
- Privacy-preserving design (only shares schemas when explicitly requested)
- Efficient request-response protocol

### Schema Exchange Flow
1. Node A discovers Node B through mDNS
2. Node A sends CheckSchemas request with list of schema names
3. Node B checks which schemas from the list are available
4. Node B responds with subset of available schemas
5. Node A receives and processes the response

### Security Considerations
- Noise protocol encryption for all connections
- PeerId-based authentication
- Automatic connection management
- Node validation checks
- Error handling for security violations
