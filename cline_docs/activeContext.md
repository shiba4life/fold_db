# Active Context

## Current Task
Implementing payment system optimizations to improve performance and reliability:
- Payment caching for frequently accessed data
- State management optimization
- Concurrent payment processing
- Invoice aggregation
- Channel rebalancing

## Recent Changes
- Completed permission wrapper implementation
  - Created wrapper module with centralized checks
  - Implemented query and mutation wrappers
  - Updated FoldDB to use wrapper methods
  - Added comprehensive tests
- Implemented Lightning Network payment system
  - Added payment calculation with trust distance scaling
  - Integrated hold invoice support
  - Added payment verification flow
- Added schema interpreter system
  - JSON schema definition format
  - Schema transformation capabilities
  - Field-level configurations

## Next Steps
1. Implement payment caching
   - Design caching strategy
   - Add cache invalidation rules
   - Implement thread-safe cache
   - Add cache metrics

2. Optimize state management
   - Improve payment state persistence
   - Add state recovery mechanisms
   - Implement state cleanup
   - Add monitoring

3. Add concurrent payment processing
   - Design concurrent processing model
   - Implement thread pool
   - Add rate limiting
   - Handle race conditions

4. Implement invoice aggregation
   - Design aggregation strategy
   - Add batching logic
   - Implement timeout handling
   - Add failure recovery

5. Add channel rebalancing
   - Monitor channel states
   - Implement rebalancing logic
   - Add automatic failover
   - Optimize channel capacity

## Implementation Plan
1. Start with payment caching as it provides immediate performance benefits
2. Move to state management to improve reliability
3. Add concurrent processing for scalability
4. Implement invoice aggregation to reduce overhead
5. Finally add channel rebalancing for network optimization
6. Add comprehensive tests for each optimization
7. Update documentation with new capabilities
