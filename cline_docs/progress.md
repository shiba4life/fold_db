## Recent Improvements
- Replaced fold_client with Docker-based implementation:
  - Replaced platform-specific sandbox mechanisms with Docker containers
  - Implemented Docker container management using bollard crate
  - Added resource limits for CPU, memory, and storage
  - Implemented network isolation capabilities
  - Enhanced IPC communication through Unix domain sockets
  - Added comprehensive documentation in DOCKER.md
  - Updated all references to fold_client in the codebase
  - Improved cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows)
  - Simplified sandbox implementation by leveraging Docker's security features
  - Enhanced container lifecycle management (creation, starting, monitoring, stopping, removal)
  - Added configurable Docker settings through environment variables

- Enhanced development workflow, fixed tests, and addressed linting issues:
  - Added `cargo test --workspace` to the pre-commit hook to run all tests across the entire workspace
  - Updated HOOKS_README.md to reflect the new test in the pre-commit hook
  - Fixed failing test `unit_tests::folddb_tests::test_write_and_query` by improving error handling in the test helper function
  - Fixed doctests in `datafold_sdk/src/schema_builder.rs` and `datafold_sdk/src/client.rs` by adding proper imports and async/await syntax
  - Fixed linting issues across the codebase:
    - Removed unused imports in various files
    - Fixed unused variables by prefixing them with underscore
    - Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` attributes to unused test helper functions
  - This ensures more comprehensive testing before each commit and improves code quality
