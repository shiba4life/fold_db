The application layer consists of sandboxed containers (e.g., Docker) created by the Datafold Node, which acts as a gatekeeper for all network access. When a user installs or launches an app, the Node checks whether its required ontology is already loaded and approved; if not, the user must grant permission. Once approved, the Node retrieves and caches any relevant data by running transformations defined in the ontology, ensuring all references link to the correct Atom_refs. The sandboxed container runs the app code, which interacts with user data only through a Node-provided API. This API enforces permission checks, transforms data as needed, and performs micropayment transactions with other nodes. For reads and writes that go beyond local data, the app calls the Nodeâ€™s external data method, which handles trust relationships, micropayment negotiation, and permission validation with the target node. Each interaction is append-only: any modifications by the app result in new Atom entries that cause transformation updates across other schemas where applicable. The container is stateless beyond its local runtime, so all persistent storage and version tracking reside with the Node, maintaining consistent trust and data management without exposing the app directly to the network.
