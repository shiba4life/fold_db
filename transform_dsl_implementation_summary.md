# Transform DSL Implementation Summary

## What We've Done

1. **Updated the AST (ast.rs)**
   - Added new data structures for transform declarations
   - Added support for input types, output types, trust levels, and payment requirements

2. **Updated the Grammar (better_transform.pest)**
   - Added rules for transform declarations
   - Added support for input, output, trust, reversible, payment, and signature declarations
   - Added support for logic blocks

3. **Updated the Transform Struct (transform.rs)**
   - Added new fields for transform declarations
   - Added methods to convert between TransformDeclaration and Transform

## What Still Needs to Be Done

1. **Fix the Parser (better_parser.rs)**
   - The current implementation has issues with the PEST grammar
   - We need to ensure the Rule enum is properly generated and imported
   - We need to fix the parsing of let statements and return statements

2. **Implement Tests**
   - Once the parser is fixed, we need to implement tests for the transform declarations
   - We need to test different combinations of fields and logic blocks

3. **Update the Executor**
   - The executor needs to be updated to handle the new transform structure
   - We need to add validation for trust bounds and payment requirements

## Next Steps

1. **Fix the PEST Grammar Issues**
   - Ensure the grammar is properly defined and doesn't have duplicate rules
   - Make sure the Rule enum is properly generated

2. **Simplify the Implementation**
   - Start with a simpler grammar that just handles the basic structure
   - Add more complex features once the basic structure is working

3. **Implement Tests Incrementally**
   - Start with simple tests for basic transform declarations
   - Add more complex tests as the implementation progresses

## Conclusion

The implementation of the Transform DSL is well underway, but there are still some issues to resolve. The most critical issue is fixing the PEST grammar and ensuring the parser can handle the full transform declaration syntax. Once these issues are resolved, we can move on to implementing the executor and adding more complex features.
